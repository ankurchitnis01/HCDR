My Contribution
Data Modeling and Building Predictive Models
My primary responsibility in this project was to develop and refine predictive models that assess the likelihood of loan applicants repaying their loans. Here are the key contributions I made:

1. Model Development
Logistic Regression: Implemented the baseline model to establish a performance threshold, focusing on preprocessing, feature selection, and parameter tuning.
Decision Tree: Built and fine-tuned to explore complex non-linear relationships, with careful consideration of tree depth and leaf size to prevent overfitting.
Random Forest: Developed to improve upon the Decision Tree by reducing variance through multiple trees, with a focus on hyperparameter tuning.
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM): Spearheaded the GBM implementation, achieving significant improvements in prediction accuracy through rigorous parameter tuning and validation.
2. Cross-Validation and Model Evaluation
Employed K-fold cross-validation for all models to reliably assess performance and avoid overfitting. This method was crucial for validating the models' performance on unseen data.
Tracked and compared ROC-AUC scores and accuracy metrics across models to identify the best performer under various scenarios.
3. Reporting and Documentation
Prepared comprehensive documentation on the model development process, including detailed descriptions of data preprocessing, model tuning strategies, and evaluation metrics.
Presented findings and model insights to stakeholders, highlighting key risk factors influencing loan repayment identified by the models.
4. Technical Tools Used
Python: Utilized for all tasks related to data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
Pandas and NumPy: Employed for data cleaning and numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: Used for building machine learning models, implementing K-fold cross-validation, and computing performance metrics.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for visualizing data to analyze model performance and feature importance.

Through these contributions, I played a crucial role in enhancing the project by providing robust predictive models that improved accuracy and offered critical insights into loan repayment behaviors.
